[![CI](https://github.com/edy29tk-sys/Shippment/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edy29tk-sys/Shippment/actions)

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running React! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore React.

This project was bootstrapped with Vite and includes a starter React app. Below are the available scripts and some next steps/roadmap included from the remote.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000/ in the Simple Browser to view your running application. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the Vitest documentation for more info.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
